      <a href="/projects/hydro">Design and Modeling of a Hydraulic Continuum Robot</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      We designed and modeled a hydraulic actutated polymer-based continuum robot for minimal invasive surgery. We manufacture the robot with a hydraulic actuator and an outer polymer-based sheath. A demonstration under a 2D phantom shows its potential under minmal invasive surgery.

    </h3>
    <p>
      In direct anterior total hip arthroplasty, accurate RA and RI angles are essential but are typically determined using X-ray, causing radiation exposure. We developed a wireless inertial-based navigation system with real-time visualization to eliminate this need.

      <a href="/projects/dip">Deep Learning Framework for Motion Reconstruction</a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      We developed a deep learning framework to reconstruct 3D human motion from sparse IMU data and UWB localization signal. The framework leverages temporal recurrent neural networks to capture motion dynamics, achieving high accuracy in motion reconstruction for applications in biomechanics and virtual reality.
