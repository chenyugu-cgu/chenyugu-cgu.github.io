    </h3>
    <p>
      For Total Hip Arthroplasty via Direct Anterior Approach, two target anlges RA and RI are crucially important for the success of the surgery. However, surgeons currently use radiographics methods such as X-ray to determine those two angles, which will result in servere radio exposure to both the patients and the surgeons. To solve this problem, we designed a inertial-based navigation system including two sensor modules enabling wireless navigation and real-time visualization.

    </h3>
    <p>
      We designed a hydraulic actutated polymer-based continuum robot for minimal invasive surgery. We manufacture the robot with a hydraulic actuator and an outer polymer-based sheath. We utilized a Preisach hysteresis model to model the tip deflection versus the input force. A demonstration under a 2D phantom shows its potential under minmal invasive surgery.
